              In 1953, the Just Born candy company bought the Rodda Candy Company. Rodda produced a handmade candy marshmallow chick and Bob Born of Just Born loved the way the marshmallow chick looked. A year later in 1954, Bob Born had a
              machine made that would mass-produce marshmallow chicks, which he trademarked Peeps. Just Born soon became the largest marshmallow candy manufacturer in the world. In the 1960s, Just Born started manufacturing
              seasonally-shaped Marshmallow Peeps. In the early 1980s, Just Born released the Marshmallow Peeps Bunny. Until 1995, Marshmallow Peeps were only produced in pink, white and yellow colors. In 1995, lavender colored Peeps were
              introduced. And in 1998, blue Peeps were introduced for Easter. In 1999, vanilla flavored Peeps were produced and a year later, a strawberry flavor was added. In 2002, a chocolate Peep was introduced. Today, Just Born produces
              more than one billion individual Peeps per year. In a year, more than 700 million Marshmallow Peeps and Bunnies are consumed by men, women, and children throughout the United States. Strange things people like to do with
              Marshmallow Peeps include eating them stale, microwaving, freezing and roasting them as well as use them as a pizza topping. Marshmallow Peeps and Bunnies come in five colors. Marshmallows have also become a versatile
              ingredient in other confections. For instance, they've been put to use as a marshmallow fudge named for Mamie Eisenhower, which is alternatively called Never-Fail Fudge. They're also used in a sandwich fit for a king called
              the Fluffernutter. According to the book The History of Fluff: "In the early 1900s, Archibald Query of Somerville made the first Fluff in his kitchen and sold it door to door. However, Query was not successful due to sugar
              shortages at the time. He sold the secret Fluff formula to two enterprising confectioners, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, for $500. These two renamed their product "Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff" and in 1920 made their
              first sale of three gallons of Fluff to a vacation lodge in New Hampshire. The price was a dollar a gallon."
